## Intermediate-level Competition

We designed the competition to allow anyone who has elementary experience with robotics to be able to build and compete.  

For 2025, robots will go head to head to compete in the arena, trying to collect as many balls as possible.  

Our competition will be great fun for competitors with any level of experience!

## Competition Day

The competition will be held at the University of Cambridge, right after term ends for most universities.  

The competition is a great way to meet other students that are as passionate about robotics as you are.  

Not to mention, it's also a good excuse to visit Cambridge!
